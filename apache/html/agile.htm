		It's been on our agenda in bu-ist to move into a more agile oriented approach with regards to project work.
		To facilitate this 4 potiential open-source (free) scrum board applications have been installed within our AWS server network.
		Each supports the scrum style (vs. kanban) and appeared to be the most popular among the available choices.
		Keep in mind that these have not been thoroughly explored and may contain bugs <i>(If you find any, let me know at wrh@bu.edu)</i>.

		<p>Taiga is in beta, but seems to be the flashiest of the lot with an architecture that draws on the more modern javascript rich ui techniques.
		</p>
		<p>Along with that is included the optional use of the WebSockets protocol for receiving notifications and updates without the user having to initiate a browser request.
		However, the WebSockets protocol does not appear to be supported directly be EC2 instances unless they are 
		fronted with an ELB that has been wrangled with to handle these types of requests correctly <i>(Mohammed, any clarification on that?)</i> 
		</p>
		<p>Kanban is also supported.

		<a target="_blank" href="http://10.57.237.86:8181/agilefant">Our Demo</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.agilefant.com/support/user-guide/">Documentation</a>
		<p>
			Agilefant has been around the longest, is scrum based, and is a standard java/mysql application.
		</p>
		<p>
			This would be the easiest of the choices to customize ourselves if we opted for it and wanted to change a few things. 
			At the very least, the database is easy to understand and manipulate directly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our demo is based on the open-source version, however the paid version ($5 per person per month) is a more modern offering that brings 
			it on par with other rich UI apps. The differences are listed in the <a target="_blank" href=https://www.agilefant.com/support/faq/>FAQ</a> section of their website.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are the first to try this out, the admin user is:
			<ul><li>username: <b>admin</b></li><li>password: <b>secret</b></li></ul>

		<p>
			Icescrum is also a java/mysql application.
		</p>
		<p>
			As with Agilefant, Icescrum offers a "community" version (our demo) and a "Pro" version.
			The differences are listed on their <a target="_blank" href=https://www.icescrum.com/features/>features</a> page.
		</p>
		<p>
			It appears also to have tool integration, among which are JIRA and Jenkins

		<a target="_blank" href="http://kunagi.org/">Documentation</a>
		<p>
			Kunagi is also a java/mysql application with a tomcat web server. It does not have a database, but uses file based storage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kunagi claims the flexibility of a desktop application through use of the Google Web Toolkit (GWT)
		</p>
		<p>
			Kunagi is fully open-source with no premium version.
